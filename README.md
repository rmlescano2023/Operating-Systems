# Operating Systems

### This is a repository for Operating Systems (CMSC 125) laboratory exercises using C.

## LAB 1
This laboratory exercise demonstrates inter-process communication and process management in C using the `fork()`, `waitpid()`, and `exit()` system calls. The program defines a parent process that creates two child processes and generates a Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term. Initially, the main function declares an integer array `fibonacci[]` to store the sequence values and computes the Fibonacci numbers using a loop.

The `fork()` system call is used to create a child process (`child1_pid`). The first child process, if successfully created, outputs its process ID and prints the entire Fibonacci sequence. Following the creation of `child1_pid`, the program attempts to create a second child process (`child2_pid`) but incorrectly accesses `child2_pid` before it is assigned with another `fork()`. This results in a logical error, as `child2_pid` is not correctly initialized.

In the parent process, the program uses `waitpid()` to synchronize the parent process with both child processes, waiting for them to finish before printing a final message and exiting. The purpose of this exercise is to provide hands-on experience with process control and observe the output generated by each process. However, a correction to the `fork()` logic for `child2_pid` would be necessary to ensure both child processes function as intended.
